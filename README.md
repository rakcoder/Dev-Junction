# Dev Junction







## Overview
**Dev Junction** is a blockchain-based payment platform where clients can hire developers for project-based or session-based work. The platform ensures secure transactions by requiring clients to prepay developers before a session begins. This guarantees that developers are compensated fairly while providing a seamless and transparent hiring experience.

## Features
- **Blockchain-Powered Payments**: Secure and transparent transactions using MetaMask.
- **Developer Hiring System**: Clients can easily find and hire developers based on their project needs.
- **Escrow Payment Model**: Funds are held securely until the session is completed.
- **Integrated Video Call**: Powered by **Zigo Cloud**, enabling seamless communication between clients and developers.
- **Tech Stack**: Built using **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** and **Next.js** for a scalable and efficient system.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Blockchain Integration**: MetaMask
- **Video Call Service**: Zego Cloud

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anan014d/Dev-Junction.git
   cd dev-junction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add necessary keys for MongoDB, MetaMask, and Vigo Cloud API

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works
1. **Client Browses & Selects a Developer**: Clients can search for developers based on skills and experience.
2. **Prepayment via Blockchain**: Clients pay upfront using MetaMask.
3. **Session Execution**: The developer and client connect via Vigo Cloud’s video call service.
4. **Payment Release**: Upon session completion, funds are released to the developer.
